Bad Newz Actor Guneet Singh Sodhi Reveals, ""Aryan Khan Stopped And Told Me...""",https://rss.oneindia.com/scripts/cms/newsFeed.php?type=dh-feed&subtype=article&site=www.filmibeat.com&path=bollywood/news/2024&id=408399,"Bad Newz starring Vicky Kaushal, Triptii Dimri, and Ammy Virk has been doing well at the box office. The film has received mixed to positive reviews, and apart from the leads, even the supporting actors have grabbed the attention. One of them is Guneet Singh Sodhi who plays the role of Harman in the movie, and has some hilarious scenes in the kitty.Filmibeat recently interacted with Guneet and spoke to him about the response he has received for his performance, experience of working with Triptii and Vicky, and more...What response have you received for your performance in Bad Newz?I have received an amazing response for my character and film as well. People who know me they have told me 'you are not even 1% like Harman'. So, that's really a good response as an actor for me. On premiere, a lot of people came and told me I was really good and who doesn't like compliments. I met many directors there, and there were a lot of industry people who were appreciating my performance. I met Aryan Khan for the first time. He was passing by and he stopped and told me 'Bro you were really good'. I was meeting him for the first time and he was really kind. People are telling my friends and family that Guneet is looking very good and his scren presence is really amazing.You got a chance to share screen space with actors like Triptii Dimri and Vicky Kaushal, how was the experience and what kind of co-stars they are on the sets?Triptii, Vicky, Amy, Neha ma'am, Sheeba Chaddha ma'am, and everyone in the cast, they were really kind to me. I was the youngest on the set, they were really in awe of me that what will I do. All of them are wonderful. Vicky bhai is a gem, he is my favourite. He made me so comfortable and he is like my big brother. They are superstars but they were treating me like family. We used to chill together, party together, gym together; we used to do a lot of things together. They all are my seniors, so I really look up to them. When it comes to co-stars, you have been very lucky. You have worked with Kareena Kapoor Khan and Sara Ali Khan both, how was that experience?Kareena ma'am and Sara are very chilled people. The ice break with them happened quickly. They are very co-operative actors, and we used to improvise. Sara and I are of same age, so there was a friendly vibe and we used to crack jokes and all. With Kareena ma'am I was a bit nervous initially, but she broke the ice and spoke to me. So, then I wasn't scared like if I have a question about acting or something else, I can ask her. I had an amazing experience with both of them.How did acting happened; when was the time you decided you want to become an actor?In school, I used to write rap and do theatre. I didn't get good parts as I was a fat kid, sometimes they made me a tree. I used to to do raps, not on stage, but like just in recess telling my friends what I have written. When I shifted to Chandigarh for my higher studies, I joined theatre. To be honest, I wanted to become a hero, a superstar, so initially it was there in my mind that I have to become famous. But when I did theatre, it really changed me as a person. So, after doing theatre I came to Mumbai, and it wasn't just about money and fame. I wanted people to know me for my work and work ethics. When I came to Mumbai, I saw that there many good actors, so I was like who will give me work? But, I really worked hard and pushed myself. I am still working hard, and I will continue it.Of course, you have already worked with some wonderful directors and actors. But, do you have one director and actor/actress you wish to work with?It is really hard to choose one director or one actor. But, of course, everyone's favourite is Shah Rukh Khan sir. So, I would love to work in a film where I get a chance to share screen space with him. Even in Bad Newz, my entry is like Shah Rukh Khan, and my background score is of Dil To Pagal Hai. There are many others like I love Rajkummar Rao, I want to do a comedy with Varun Dhawan. Everyone like Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Kiara Advani; whoever is doing well I want to work with them. In directors, the list is long, it won't end; Rajkumar Hirani, Zoya ma'am, Anurag Kashyap, Anurag Basu, Imtiaz Ali; and yes, a lot of them.Tell us something about your upcoming projects.I am auditioning for some really good projects, and I have been shortlisted for some of them.
