From the comedy-drama ""Death is a Problem for the Living"" directed by Teemu Nikki, to the romantic-drama ""Five and a Half Love Stories In An Apartment In Vilnius, Lithuania"" helmed by Tomas Vengris, the day was a rollercoaster of cinematic experiences.After the screening of the film Five and a Half Love Stories in an Apartment in Vilnius, Lithuania, the audience enjoyed an engaging panel discussion featuring Tomas Vengris, the director of the film, and Yile Yara Vianello, actress from the opening film La Chimera. The session was moderated by Padmapriya Janakiraman-founder of Padma's Lit Club, an accomplished dancer, and a seasoned actor with over 15 years in Indian cinema, including lead roles in more than 60 films across six languages.The panel delved into the theme ""Longing and Desire: On Screen,"" with each speaker sharing personal stories that explored the complexities of relationships, love, and the tension between personal dreams and societal pressures. Their insights resonated deeply, leaving a lasting impact on the audience.During the panel, Tomas Vengris, the director of Five and a Half Love Stories in an Apartment in Vilnius, Lithuania, shared how he was drawn to the complex, often absurd emotions within relationships and aimed to bring these to life through his film.He further added that, at some point, he decided to show these stories through the perspective of an apartment, through the POV of a physical building that has been there for centuries and has lived through a million stories, with people who've come in and gone out of it. As per him, this somehow allowed him to step back and reflect on things. According to him, part of working in the comic genre is being able to watch from the side. Drama is when you're looking directly into the perspective, but comedies allow you to step back a little bit, and that gives you the permission to laugh, and by placing the camera in the perspective of the apartment, gave one the permission to laugh. The camera is therefore in another room-behind a shelf, higher up and lower, at every angle so it doesn't feel like a human being is watching the scene. Some of the little dream sequences in the film or interludes were also meant to show the feeling of this apartment's spirit.The 29th European Union Film Festival (EUFF) is currently ongoing in New Delhi till the 16th of November.",News,"european union film festival, euff 2024",427427,"relationship, love, cinematographer","european union film festival, euff 2024, relationship, love, cinematographer","comedy drama, romantic drama","european union film festival, euff 2024, relationship, love, cinematographer","[{'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': 0.999979, 'word': 'Teemu Nikki', 'start': 212, 'end': 223}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': 0.9999763, 'word': 'Tomas Vengris', 'start': 326, 'end': 339}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': 0.9996088, 'word': 'Yile Yara Vianello', 'start': 599, 'end': 617}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': 0.9988009, 'word': 'Padmapriya Janakira', 'start': 690, 'end': 709}]",[]

I've tried everything I was strongly advised to take. As advised by highly qualified professionals and after doing as much self research as is possible for a lay person like me.Many of these treatments were also very very expensive. I would always keep thinking about how fortunate I am that I could afford it and about all those who cannot. And for the longest time, conventional treatments weren't making me better. There's a good chance it was just me and am sure they will work very well for others.These two factors led me to also read up on alternate therapies and treatments. And after trial and error, I found treatments that worked wonderfully for me. Treatments that also cost a fraction of what / was spending on conventional healthcare.I am not naive enough to go about strongly advocating a treatment. / merely suggested with good intention because of all that I have faced and learnt in the last couple of years. Especially that treatments can be financially draining and many may not be able to afford them. End of the day, we all depend on educated doctors to guide us. This treatment was suggested to me by a highly qualified doctor who is an MD, who has served DRDO for 25 years. He, after all his education in conventional medicine, chose to advocate an alternate therapy.A certain gentleman has attacked my post and my intentions with rather strong words. Said gentleman is a Doctor too. I have no doubt that he knows more than I do. And I am quite sure his intentions were noble. It would have been kind and compassionate of him had he not been so provocative with his words. Especially the bit where he suggests I should be thrown in prison. Never mind. I suppose it goes with the territory of being a celebrity. I posted as someone who needs medical treatments and not as a celebrity. And I certainly am not making any money from the post nor endorsing anyone. I was merely suggesting a treatment as an option after undergoing it myself, for others who may be looking for options because conventional medicine isn't working for them. Especially more affordable options.We cannot just give up when medicines aren't working. I certainly wasn't ready to give up...Coming back to the topic of the said gentleman Doctor, it would have been nice had he politely invited my Doctor, whom I have tagged in my post, rather than go after me. I would have loved to have learnt from that debate and discussion between two highly qualified professionals.And as far as sharing information about the treatments that have helped my health, I shall be more careful as my intentions are only to help others. Not to harm anyone. I've had so many well meaning people suggesting ayurveda, homeopathy, acupuncture, Tibetan medicine, pranic healing etc. I heard them all out. I was merely doing something similar. Sharing something that worked for me, as an option. And I know many of us dealing with health issues need that help, especially given how overwhelming it is when every option has qualified people who are so certainly sure of their polar opposite opinions. Both sides, for and against every treatment, are both so sure and persuasive. It's difficult to navigate these and find good help,(sic).""After the actress posted a picture of herself trying the 'alternative medicine hack' which is also cost-effective. She said, ""Before taking medication for a common viral, consider trying an alternative approach. One option is to nebulize with a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and distilled water. Works like magic. Avoid unnecessary use of tablets."" She also tagged a doctor's Instagram handle along with her post.The Liver Doc is one of the first to react to her post and said ""Influential Indian actress Ms Samantha Ruth Prabhu, who is, unfortunately, a health and science illiterate, advises millions of her followers to inhale hydrogen peroxide to prevent and treat respiratory viral infections,(sic)."" He also suggested that hydrogen peroxide nebulization is life-threatening. He shared a picture and a link to the advice by a US-based organization which reads, ""Do not put hydrogen peroxide into your nebulizer and breathe it in. This is dangerous. It is not a way to prevent nor treat COVID-19.""",News,"samantha, citadel, samantha ruth prabhu",404989,"health, celebrity","samantha, citadel, samantha ruth prabhu, health, celebrity","alternative medicine, hydrogen peroxide, nebulizer","samantha, citadel, samantha ruth prabhu, health, celebrity","[{'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': 0.9999044, 'word': 'Samantha', 'start': 0, 'end': 8}]",['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha']

Earlier, talking to Zoom entertainment, Kriti Sanon said, ""I was emotionally invested (in Do Patti). I don't think I ended up detaching myself. It started with the fact that I wanted to produce something and tell a story that talks about this subject a little more deeply. A lot of films have been done well but I felt there was a lot more depth in it and it had to be hard-hitting. It is a hard-hitting reality and it is getting worse. The idea was to do it as sensitively as we could without shying away from really showing and talking (about domestic violence).""She further added, ""When you do those scenes, it is not possible for it to not affect you at all. It does affect you. You have to feel it, go through it and move on. That is just a scene and I know that. But, that's someone's reality.

Nandamuri Balakrishna, the son of the legendary, late Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao (NTR), one of the pillars of the Telugu film industry and politician who served as the CM under his Telugu Desam Party (TDP), is celebrating 50 years in Tollywood. The massive achievement is going to be celebrated on a large scale with the who's who of the Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, and Hindi industries coming together.The Golden Jubilee celebrations event is being held on September 1 at the Novotel HICC in Hyderabad and the heads of all the filmmaking departments have pitched in to look into the arrangements. Apart from the plethora of actors who are from the current generation to the people who worked with Balayya since his debut, the extravagant event is also going to see politicians and Chief Ministers of the Telugu-speaking states coming under the roof.As the preparations have come to an end, we hear that the organizers have not invited Jr NTR, Balakrishna's elder brother Hari Krishna's son to the event. According to the latest insider buzz from Tollywood, Jr NTR was not invited to the event which is nothing but solidifying the internal clashes that the Nandamuri family are holding onto.Jr NTR & Nandamuri Kalyan Ram To Stay Away?While other star heroes are invited and they RSVPed, it is believed that Jr NTR and his half-brother Nandamuri Kalyan Ram, who also didn't receive an invitation to the event, will stay away from it. The brothers have come close and have stuck together ever since the death of their father Hari Krishna and another brother Janaki Ram.Recently, at the condolence meeting held for Taraka Ratna, videos of Nandamuri Balakrishna ignoring Jr NTR on purpose surfaced online, much to the disappointment of the Nandamuri fans. Jr NTR, who earlier was always cheering and openly speaking about his affection for Balayya Babai is maintaining a distance of late.Fans of Jr NTR opined that Jr NTR was different at that time when he campaigned for TDP and Chandra Babu Naidu trying to get close to the Nandamuri family. Now, he is different and has been keeping himself at bay from the political and familial associations after his father's death.Mega Family & Allu Family Heroes On A Single StageMeanwhile, Tollywood is curious about the coming together of Allu Arjun and the mega heroes headed by megastar Chiranjeevi for the 'NBK 50 Years In TFI' celebrations. Chiranjeevi is anyway going to attend the event because he and NBK belong to a generation and are friends. Allu Arjun, who received the invitation gave his green signal.Allu Arjun's fans and mega fans are always debating on the social media handles of late and Allu Arjun's stand for his friend during the election campaign irked the mega fans. But there have been fissures in the mega and Allu compounds even before.On the work front, Jr NTR is working on the last leg of Devara Part 1 with Janhvi Kapoor under the direction of Koratala Siva.

For those unversed, Salman was accused of killing a blackbuck - which the Bishnoi community consider as a sacred animal - during the shoot of his film 'Hum Saath Saath Hain' in Rajasthan. Now, according to multiple reports surfacing online, the gang has also allegedly planned to kill popular comedian . As per a Times Now report, Munawar was under their radar for allegedly mocking Hindu gods during his comic stints.

This role holds a special place in Rishaab's heart, marking a significant step in his acting career. Interestingly, Risha is related to Indian comedian and actor Krushna Abhishek, a connection that brings an intriguing perspective to his journey in the entertainment industry. Rishaab recently opened up about Krushna's reaction to his new role and shared his thoughts on the influence of nepotism in the industry.Rishaab recounted the moment Krushna Abhishek learned of his foray into television with ""Ishq Jabariya,"" expressing joy and support for his cousin's milestone. This reaction highlights the familial bond within the entertainment sphere and showcases how connections can play a role in an artist's career trajectory. However, when delving into the topic of nepotism, Rishaab provided a nuanced take that challenges common perceptions. He argued that while familial ties might offer an initial advantage, they do not ensure lasting success or talent in the industry.""In this industry, it's about knowing you have a good friend by your side. If nepotism were the key, there are many big stars whose children haven't been able to achieve much. This field is unique because talent isn't something you can pass on. You can provide financial support, but you can't expect someone to inherit skills. It's like Sachin Tendulkar; his son might not bat as well as him, or he could even be better, but it won't be the same. Krushna didn't know I was doing the show until I started. In this industry, it's best to wait until everything is set before announcing your projects,"" Rishaab explained, shedding light on the complexity of nepotism's impact.Rishaab further elaborated on nepotism, comparing it to a helpful push that can get someone started but cannot sustain them indefinitely. He emphasized that true talent and perseverance are essential for success, regardless of one's initial advantages. ""I believe you can give someone a push, like helping them start on a bicycle, but you can't keep pushing them their whole life. You help them sit, give them that initial push, and as long as someone holds on, they'll keep going. But eventually, you have to let go. A true artist will keep going, and if not, they'll fall off. Nepotism might give someone a start, but it doesn't guarantee stardom. Stars are made; no one can simply declare you a star. There are many big stars whose children haven't made it, while others have done more work. Some haven't even had the chance to pursue acting despite their desires. Nepotism only helps to the extent of giving someone a first chance because they are someone's child,"" Rishaab shared, offering a candid perspective on the ongoing debate surrounding nepotism in Bollywood.""Ishq Jabariya"" itself is a romantic drama that enthralls viewers with the story of Gulki, a young woman with dreams bigger than the constraints placed by her controlling stepmother. The narrative weaves through her challenges, ambitions, and the unexpected turns her life takes, possibly leading her to find love in the least expected places. The show, which airs on Sun Neo from Monday to Saturday at 7:30 PM, features a talented cast including Kamya Panjabi, Siddhi Sharma, and Lakshay Khurana in key roles. It presents a compelling story that resonates with many, mirroring the real-life experiences of those navigating their paths in the vast world of entertainment.",News,"ishq jabariya, rishaab chauhaan, krushna abhishek",424671,"acting career, nepotism, entertainment industry, family","ishq jabariya, rishaab chauhaan, krushna abhishek, acting career, nepotism, entertainment industry, family",television debut,"ishq jabariya, rishaab chauhaan, krushna abhishek, acting career, nepotism, entertainment industry, family","[{'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': 0.99998456, 'word': 'Rishaab Chauhaan', 'start': 0, 'end': 16}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': 0.824082, 'word': 'Sun Neo', 'start': 58, 'end': 65}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': 0.99989295, 'word': 'Ritwik', 'start': 135, 'end': 141}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': 0.9999736, 'word': 'Aditya', 'start': 157, 'end': 163}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': 0.99997663, 'word': 'Lakshay Khurana', 'start': 175, 'end': 190}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': 0.9999611, 'word': 'Rishaab', 'start': 227, 'end': 234}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': 0.9999717, 'word': 'Risha', 'start': 308, 'end': 313}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': 0.9999616, 'word': 'Krushna Abhishek', 'start': 354, 'end': 370}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': 0.9996304, 'word': 'Krushna', 'start': 502, 'end': 509}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': 0.99997675, 'word': 'Sachin Tendulkar', 'start': 1507, 'end': 1523}]","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_TV_Network', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Piscium', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krushna_Abhishek', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krushna', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar']"
