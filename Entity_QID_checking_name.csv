He began his career as a fashion model before turning to film roles, having starred in She's the Man (2006), Step Up (2006), Fighting (2009), Public Enemies (2009), G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra (2009), and Dear John (2010).Early lifeChanning Tatum was born in Cullman, Alabama, the son of Kay, an airline worker, and Glenn Tatum, who worked in construction. His ancestry includes Irish, French and Native American. Tatum's family moved to Mississippi when he was six, and he grew up in the bayous near the Mississippi River, where he enjoyed a rural existence.Tatum was athletic while growing up, playing football, soccer, track, baseball, and performing martial arts; he has said that ""girls were always [his] biggest distraction in school."" As a child, he practiced kung fu. Tatum spent most of his teenage years in the Tampa, Florida area and initially attended Gaither High School before going to Tampa Catholic High School. He graduated in 1998 and was voted most athletic. Afterward, Tatum was awarded a football scholarship to Glenville State College in Glenville, West Virginia, but he turned it down. He returned home and started working odd jobs. US Weekly reported that around this time Tatum began working as an exotic dancer at a local nightclub, under the name ""Chan Crawford."" In 2010, he told an Australian newspaper that he would like to make a movie about his experiences as a stripper, saying, ""I've already got the director picked out. I'd like Nicolas Refn, who did the movie Bronson, to do it because he's insane for it."" He later moved to Miami, where he was discovered on the street by a model talent scout.CareerEarly workTatum was first cast as a dancer in Ricky Martin's ""She Bangs"" music video, after an audition in Orlando, Florida; he was paid $400 for the job. His first experience was in the fashion industry as a model, working for such noted clients such as Armani and Abercrombie & Fitch. He soon moved into television commercials, landing national spots for Mountain Dew and Pepsi in 2002.

He was picked as one of Tear Sheet magazine's ""50 Most Beautiful Faces"" of October 2001. Tatum also signed with Beatrice Model agency in Milan, Italy and Ford Models in New York City.Tatum has said that his modeling career has helped him with his life, specifying that ""It's made my life, and my family's life, a lot easier, because I never knew what I wanted to do and now they don't really have to worry about me anymore. I've been able to explore life, and through exploring it I've found that I love art, I love writing, I love acting, I love all the things that make sense to me. And I've been given the chance to go out and see the world, and to see all the things out there. Not everyone gets that chance"". 2004–2007In 2004, Tatum started his acting career, appearing in an episode of the television series CSI: Miami. His first feature film role was in 2005's high school drama, Coach Carter, playing Jason Lyle, a basketball player opposite Samuel L. Jackson; Tatum also appeared in rapper Twista's ""Hope"" music video, which accompanied the film. In the same year, Tatum had a role as a factory endorsed top motocross racer in Supercross, and part of the supporting cast in Havoc. He was also in Ciara's music video, Get Up, which featured Chamillionare. Although Tatum has said that he loves modeling, he has taken a break from the profession to concentrate on his acting career, saying that he prefers making more mature films.Tatum was originally scheduled to play Genghis Khan in the film Mongol, but was replaced by actor Tadanobu Asano. He was eventually cast in the film She's the Man, where he plays Duke, the love interest of Viola Hastings, Amanda Bynes's character. The film opened on March 17, 2006, and it was a modest success at the box office, grossing about $57 million worldwide.That same year, in 2006, Tatum starred in Step Up, a dance-themed romance, playing a rebellious hip-hop dancer who must partner with a ballerina who is in training played by Jenna Dewan which opened on August 11, 2006. The film earned a total of $21 million in its opening weekend and $114 million worldwide. Later that year, Tatum played in the 1980s-set drama A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints starring Robert Downey, Jr. and Shia LaBeouf, in which he plays Antonio, a street youth in Astoria, Queens who uses his fists to solve problems. Tatum has described the latter film as his ""first dramatic role""; his performance received positive notices at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival, where the film premiered. The acclaim continued when he received an Independent Spirit Award nomination for ""Best Supporting Actor"". 2008–presentIn 2008, Tatum co-starred in director Kimberly Peirce's film Stop-Loss, about soldiers returning home from the Iraq War, and in director Stuart Townsend's film Battle in Seattle, about the 1999 protest of the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle. Tatum played in the indie film The Trap, which was directed by Rita Wilson. He was chosen for a role in the film Poor Things, starring Lindsay Lohan, Shirley MacLaine, Rosario Dawson, and Olympia Dukakis, but had to turn it down because of scheduling conflicts.Tatum and Dito Montiel, who worked together on A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints, reteamed on the action drama Fighting for Rogue Pictures. Tatum starred as Sean McArthur, a young man who scrapes up a living scalping tickets in New York City. Tatum next appeared in writer/director/producer Michael Mann's 2009 crime drama Public Enemies, playing the 1930s American gangster Pretty Boy Floyd. The same year, Tatum starred as Duke in G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, Paramount Pictures' live-action film based on the popular Hasbro action figures. He also played a soldier in Dear John, a Screen Gems film based on a popular Nicholas Sparks bestseller.Tatum and Dito Montiel will join forces again when Channing stars in 2010's action thriller The Brotherhood of the Rose. Montiel will both write and direct the film. The story is a cat-and-mouse espionage tale about two orphans raised by a top CIA agent to become assassins. When their operations go awry, they find themselves on the run, caught in a conspiracy and hunted by the most dangerous spies in the world. The book was previously adapted as a two-part NBC miniseries in 1989 that starred David Morse, Peter Strauss, Connie Sellecca, and Robert Mitchum.Tatum suffered a burn injury from an accident while filming The Eagle of the Ninth in Scotland. A crew member poured boiling water down Tatum's wetsuit, having forgotten to dilute the boiling water with cold river water, a technique used to keep actors warm during the shooting of a river-scene. Tatum attempted to pull the wetsuit away from his body, but the water poured down into the crotch of his wetsuit and severely burned his penis. Tatum reported the boiling water ""pretty much burned the skin off the head of my dick"" and that ""it was the most painful thing I have ever experienced in my life."" However, Tatum reports that ""Now my penis is fantastic! One hundred percent recovered.""Along with friends Reid Carolin, Adam Martingano, Brett Rodriguez, and wife Jenna Dewan, Tatum has started a production company called 33andOut Productions. Their first production is a documentary called Earth Made of Glass that follows the Rwandan President Paul Kagame and genocide survivor Jean-Pierre Sagahutu. The film was selected to premiere at the 2010 Tribeca Film Festival.Tatum is currently in negotiations to star alongside Jonah Hill in the film adaptation of 21 Jump Street.Personal lifeIn 2006, Tatum met Jenna Dewan on the set of Step Up. They began dating shortly after filming had finished. The couple became engaged in early September 2008 in Maui, Hawaii. On Saturday, July 11, 2009, they were married on the grounds of Church Estates Vineyards in Malibu, California.

5413,Jeff Bridges,Actor,Actor,male,https://www.filmibeat.com/img/220x275/popcorn/profile_photos/jeff-bridges-5413.jpg,04 Dec 1949,"Los Angeles, California",US,,"Jeffrey Leon ""Jeff"" Bridges born in December 4, 1949 is an American actor and musician. His most notable films include The Big Lebowski, King Kong, The Last Picture Show, Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, Tron, Starman, The Fabulous Baker Boys, Seabiscuit, K-PAX, The Fisher King, Fearless, The Contender, Iron Man, Tron: Legacy, True Grit and Crazy Heart, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role at the 82nd Academy Awards.Early lifeJeffrey Bridges was born in Los Angeles, California, the son of actress and writer Dorothy Bridges (née Simpson) and actor Lloyd Bridges. He has an older brother, actor Beau Bridges, and a younger sister, Lucinda. Another brother, Garrett, died of sudden infant death syndrome in 1948. Growing up, Bridges shared a close relationship with his brother Beau, who acted as a surrogate father when their father was working. Bridges and his siblings were raised in the Holmby Hills section of Los Angeles. He served in the U.S. Coast Guard in the late 1960s, and as a reservist in the early 1970s.Film careerIn his youth, Bridges, as well as his brother Beau, made occasional appearances on their father's show Sea Hunt (1958–1961) and the CBS anthology series, The Lloyd Bridges Show (1962–1963).His first major role was in the 1971 movie The Last Picture Show for which he garnered a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He was nominated again for the same award for his performance opposite Clint Eastwood in the 1974 film Thunderbolt and Lightfoot. In 1976, he starred as the protagonist Jack Prescott in the first remake of King Kong, opposite Jessica Lange. This film was a huge commercial success, earning back $90 million worldwide, more than triple its $23 million budget, and also winning an Academy Award for special effects.One of his better known roles was in the 1982 science-fiction cult classic Tron, in which he played Kevin Flynn, a video game programmer (a role he reprised in late 2010 with the sequel Tron: Legacy). He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1984 for playing the alien in Starman. He was also acclaimed for his roles in the thriller Against All Odds and the crime drama Jagged Edge. His role in Fearless is recognized by some critics to be one of his best performances. One critic dubbed it a masterpiece; Pauline Kael wrote that he ""may be the most natural and least self-conscious screen actor that has ever lived"". He also starred as ""The Dude"" in the Coen Brothers' cult-classic film The Big Lebowski.In 2000, he received his fourth Academy Award nomination for his role in The Contender. He also starred in the 2005 Terry Gilliam movie Tideland, his second with the director (the first being 1991's The Fisher King). He shaved his trademark mane of hair to play the role of Obadiah Stane in the 2008 Marvel comic book adaptation Iron Man. In July 2008, at the San Diego Comic-Con International, he appeared in a teaser for TRON: Legacy, shot as concept footage for director Joseph Kosinski; this developed into a full 3D feature release in 2010.In 2010, Bridges won the Academy Award for Best Actor, Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Drama, and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role for his role as Bad Blake in the film Crazy Heart. (Bridges is one of the oldest actors ever to win an Academy Award; he was also one of the youngest actors ever to be nominated. In 2010, he won his Oscar for Crazy Heart at the age of 60; in 1972, he was nominated for The Last Picture Show at age 22.)He received his sixth Academy Award nomination for his role in True Grit, a collaboration with the Coen brothers in which he starred alongside Matt Damon, Josh Brolin, Barry Pepper, and Hailee Steinfeld. Both the film, and Bridges' performance as Rooster Cogburn, were critically praised.Other workBridges had been an amateur photographer since high school, and began taking photographs on movie sets during Starman, at the suggestion of co-star Karen Allen. He has published many of these photographs online and in the 2003 Pictures: Photographs by Jeff Bridges.Bridges is also a cartoonist. Some of his ""doodles"" have appeared in films including K-PAX and The Door in the Floor. Bridges narrated the documentary Lost in La Mancha (2002), about the ""unmaking"" of a Terry Gilliam retelling of Don Quixote, tentatively titled The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, which would have starred Johnny Depp as Sancho Panza and Jean Rochefort as the quixotic hero. Bridges also narrated the documentaries Lewis & Clark: Great Journey West (2002, IMAX), Raising the Mammoth (2000, TV), and The Heroes of Rock and Roll (1979, TV). He also voiced the character Big Z in the animated picture Surf's Up.Bridges has performed TV commercial voice-over work as well, including Hyundai's 2007 ""Think About It"" advertisement campaign as well as the Duracell advertisements in the ""Trusted Everywhere"" campaign.On January 15, 2010 Bridges performed the song ""I Don't Know"" from Crazy Heart on The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien. In the film The Contender, in which he co-starred, Bridges recorded a version of Johnny Cash's standard ""Ring of Fire"" with Kim Carnes that played over the pivotal opening credits.In February 2010, he was among the nearly 80 musicians to sing on the charity-single remake of We Are the World.On December 18, 2010, Bridges hosted NBC's Saturday Night Live; he had hosted the show before in 1983 with his brother, Beau. With the December 18, 2010 episode, Bridges beat Sigourney Weaver's record for longest gap between hosting appearances on SNL (Weaver had a 24-year gap between her first time hosting in 1986 and her second time hosting in 2010, while Bridges had a 27-year gap between his first appearance in 1983 and his most recent one, also in 2010).Personal lifeBridges married Susan Geston in 1977. They met on the movie shoot of Rancho Deluxe, which was filmed on a ranch where Geston was working as a maid. They have three daughters: Isabelle (born in 1981), Jessica Lily (born in 1983), and Hayley Roselouise (born in 1985). Bridges is also a known cannabis user; in an interview, he admitted to giving up smoking marijuana during the filming of The Big Lebowski, but says he has not ""permanently kicked the habit.""Bridges has studied Buddhism and has referred to himself as ""A Buddhistly bent guy sounds kind of right. I haven’t taken the refuge vows... Just like I have so much resistance to this Buddhist stuff. I’m attracted, but I’m a human being, I’m attached to myself, and I kind of dig it. You know?""Bridges meditates for half an hour before beginning work on a film set",http://www.filmibeat.com/scripts/popcorn/feeds/feed-api-controller.php?action=celeb-data&section=filmography&celeb-id=5413,http://www.filmibeat.com/scripts/popcorn/feeds/feed-api-controller.php?action=celeb-data&section=upcoming-movies&celeb-id=5413,http://www.filmibeat.com/scripts/popcorn/feeds/feed-api-controller.php?action=celeb-data&section=unkown-facts&celeb-id=5413,http://www.filmibeat.com/scripts/popcorn/feeds/feed-api-controller.php?action=celeb-data&section=news&celeb-id=5413,http://www.filmibeat.com/scripts/popcorn/feeds/feed-api-controller.php?action=celeb-data&section=videos&celeb-id=5413,http://www.filmibeat.com/scripts/popcorn/feeds/feed-api-controller.php?action=celeb-data&section=gallery&celeb-id=5413,http://www.filmibeat.com/scripts/popcorn/feeds/feed-api-controller.php?action=celeb-data&section=awards&celeb-id=5413,Jeff Bridges,Q174843,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bridges

Jagadish Kumar, popularly known as Jagadish, is a Malayalam film actor and script writer. He became popular through performances in films such as Mukhachitram, In Harihar Nagar, Godfather, and Hitler. A post graduate rank holder, Jagadish's transition from a college lecturer to a film actor was a smooth one. He was a lead actor in a number of movies in the 1990s, but then mainly got character roles. He has unparalleled flair for comedy most notable in the movie In Harihar Nagar.Jagadish was born to K. Parameshwaran Nair and P. Bhasurangi Amma on 12 June, 1958, in Chenkal, Neyyattinkara, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India. Jagadish finished his formal education earning Master of Commerce degree with Kerala University. Later, he became a lecturer in a college in Thiruvananthapuram. He had dreams of becoming a film actor, so he took a long leave from his job to try his hand in films.Jagadish debuted in films with a minor role in My Dear Kuttichathan (1984), which was India's first 3D film. Jagadish became an established actor with his roles in Mutharamkunnu P.O. (1985), Nandi Veendum Varika (1986), Manivatharile Aayiram Sivarathrikal (1987) and Vandanam (1989). In his early career, Jagadish wrote stories and screenplays for a few films, including super-hits like Mazha Peyyunnu Maddalam Kottunnu (1986) (story), Manivatharile Aayiram Sivarathrikal (1987) (dialogue) and Adhipan (1989) (screenplay). Jagadish's performance as Appukkuttan in In Harihar Nagar (1990), directed by Siddique-Lal was highly acclaimed. Jagadish proved himself again with a terrific comic timing with his role as Mayeen kutty in Godfather (1991), which also was directed by the same director duo. The scenes from films are still favoured a lot in TV comedy programmes. Post the success of Godfather, he gradually got protagonist roles in the 1990s and managed to make a few hits out of them. Jagadish has established the image of the comic hero who evokes spontaneous laughter with his own brand of humour. From comedy roles, Jagadish has moved on into important roles that have made him dear to the audience. He is one of the few performers who is compatible both in front of the camera and on the stage in front of the audience. He comes alive on stage with his self-mocking stances and improvised dialogues.Jagadish is married to Dr. P. Rama, a forensic professor in the Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram.

4968,Kate Winslet,Actress,Actress,female,https://www.filmibeat.com/img/220x275/popcorn/profile_photos/kate-winslet-4968.jpg,05 Oct 1975,"Berkshire, England",GB,,"Kate Elizabeth Winslet is an English actress and singer. She is noted for having played a wide range of diverse characters over her career, but is probably best-known for her critically acclaimed performances as Juliet Hulme in Heavenly Creatures (1994), Marianne Dashwood in Sense and Sensibility (1995), Rose DeWitt Bukater in Titanic (1997), Iris Murdoch in Iris (2001), Clementine Kruczynski in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), Sarah Pierce in Little Children (2006), Hanna Schmitz in The Reader (2008), and April Wheeler in Revolutionary Road (2008).She has received the Screen Actors Guild Award, two BAFTA Awards, the Grammy Award, and two Golden Globe Awards and has been nominated for five Academy Awards, seven Golden Globes and an Emmy. At the age of 22, she broke the record for the youngest person to receive two Oscar nominations, and each of her subsequent nominations has broken a further record: the youngest person to receive three, four, and five nominations. David Edelstein of New York Magazine hails Winslet as ""the best English-speaking film actress of her generation"".Early LifeKate Winslet was born in Reading, England, the daughter of Sally Ann (née Bridges), a barmaid, and Roger John Winslet, a swimming-pool contractor. Both of her parents were also actors. Her maternal grandparents, Linda (Plumb) and Archibald Oliver Bridges, founded and operated the Reading Repertory, and her uncle, Robert Bridges, appeared in the original West End production of Oliver! Her sisters, Beth Winslet and Anna Winslet, are also actresses.Winslet, raised as an Anglican, began studying drama at the age of eleven at the Redroofs Theatre School, a co-educational independent school in Maidenhead, Berkshire, where she was the head girl and appeared in a television commercial for Sugar Puffs cereal, directed by Tim Pope. Throughout her adolescence, she was severely bullied for being overweight and having large feet (which she inherited from her mother).CareerWinslet's career began on television, with a co-starring role in the BBC children's science fiction serial Dark Season in 1991. This was followed by appearances in the made-for-TV movie Anglo-Saxon Attitudes in 1992 and an episode of medical drama Casualty in 1993, also for the BBC.Her film career took off with praise and recognition in 1994 when she starred in a joint leading role, as Juliet Hulme in director Peter Jackson's critically acclaimed Heavenly Creatures, playing a vivacious and imaginative teen who helps her best friend (played by Melanie Lynskey) murder her mother, when they are not allowed to be together.This role was followed by the successful film Sense and Sensibility (co-starring Emma Thompson), which made her well known, especially in the UK. Winslet became famous worldwide after the 1997 release of Titanic, a massive hit which holds the record as highest-grossing film in history at more than US$1.8 billion in box-office worldwide. It went on to win 11 Academy Awards.She was also originally cast as Nola Rice in Woody Allen's movie, Match Point, but declined. She stated she had just finished two movies and wanted to spend time with her kids. The part went to Scarlett Johansson.Winslet has been regarded as something of a critics' darling, generally receiving positive reviews for every one of her films. Despite Titanic's success, she continued making lower-budget, independent films, including Hideous Kinky and Holy Smoke; her roles in these smaller, more artistic films appear to be one of choice—she turned down the lead in Shakespeare in Love to make Hideous Kinky; ironically, she appeared as Ophelia in Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet. She was even considered for the role of Satine in ""Moulin Rouge!"". Throughout her career, she often turned down roles in high-profile films, such as Anna and the King and Éowyn in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy. She has also taken several roles in studio ""period dramas"" like Quills, Titanic and Finding Neverland. For a time, she was given the nickname ""Corset Kate"".In 2005, Winslet appeared in a television commercial for American Express. As part of the ""My Life, My Card"" campaign, the ad shows Winslet strolling around Camden Lock, in London, as she makes references to all the events that have happened to her film characters: going to prison for murder (Heavenly Creatures), being penniless and heartbroken (Sense and Sensibility), almost drowning (Titanic), losing her mind (Hamlet), having her memory erased (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind), and being in Neverland (Finding Neverland). During the ad, she is shown holding items relating to her films; during the reference to Sense and Sensibility she thumbs through a copy of the book, and when she references Finding Neverland, she's holding a hook. When Winslet talks about nearly drowning at age 20 in Titanic, she is walking over a bridge with water underneath it, in reference to the iceberg and water seen in the film.Winslet also appeared in an episode of BBC's comedy series Extras in August 2005, as a satirical version of 'herself'. She memorably told Andy and Maggie, the two characters who star in the series, that she was doing a film about the Holocaust because she was tired of losing out on Oscars, as at the time she had been nominated four times, and that everyone who does a film about the Holocaust wins an Oscar. She also (while dressed as a nun) was shown giving phone sex tips to the romantically challenged Maggie. Ricky Gervais (who is a native of the same town as Winslet, Reading, as is her husband Sam Mendes) later said on NPR that she was his favourite guest star. Her performance in the episode did lead to her being nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Performance in a Comedy Series, but she did not win.As of March 2007, Leonardo DiCaprio signed to co-star in Revolutionary Road with Winslet as Frank and April Wheeler, a 1950s couple who appear content on the surface but are withering internally. The film was the first to reunite the notable duo, who have remained close since their first pairing in Titanic.There were also talks that Winslet's husband, Sam Mendes and his production company, Neal Street Productions, purchased the film rights to the long-delayed biography of circus tiger tamer Mabel Stark. Winslet had stated that she had been eager to portray this complex woman for three years now and was looking forward to working with her husband on bringing this to the screen. MusicWinslet has also enjoyed a brief taste of success as a singer, with her single What If from the soundtrack of Christmas Carol: The Movie, which reached #1 in Ireland and #6 in the UK (she also filmed a music video for the song). She has also participated in a duet with ""Weird Al"" Yankovic on the Sandra Boynton CD Dog Train, and sang in the 2006 film Romance and Cigarettes. She also sang an aria from La Boheme, called ""Sono andati"", in her film Heavenly Creatures, which is featured on the film's soundtrack. She was considered for the lead in Moulin Rouge! (which eventually went to Nicole Kidman); had she taken the part, she would have sung the full soundtrack.Personal LifeWinslet at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival.While on the set of Dark Season, Winslet started a five-year romance with actor and writer Stephen Tredre. They moved to London during their relationship. After their romance, she began a relationship with Rufus Sewell. After filming Titanic, Tredre died of bone cancer. Winslet was not at the premiere of Titanic because she was attending his funeral in London. She is good friends with Titanic co-star Leonardo DiCaprio.On 22 November 1998, Winslet married director Jim Threapleton. The two have a daughter, Mia Honey, who was born on 12 October 2000. After a divorce in 2001, Winslet began a relationship with Sam Mendes, whom she married on 24 May 2003 on the island of Anguilla in the Caribbean. Their son, Joe Alfie Mendes, was born on 22 December 2003. On the Tonight Show on 15 December 2008 Kate said that Joe Alfie currently prefers to be called Travier.The media, particularly in England have enthusiastically documented her weight fluctuations over the years. Winslet has been outspoken about her refusal to lose weight in order to conform to the Hollywood ideal. In February 2003, the British edition of Gentlemen's Quarterly magazine published photographs of Winslet which had been digitally enhanced to make her look dramatically thinner than she really was; Winslet issued a statement saying that the alterations were made without her consent. GQ issued an apology in the subsequent issue.",http://www.filmibeat.com/scripts/popcorn/feeds/feed-api-controller.php?action=celeb-data&section=filmography&celeb-id=4968,http://www.filmibeat.com/scripts/popcorn/feeds/feed-api-controller.php?action=celeb-data&section=upcoming-movies&celeb-id=4968,http://www.filmibeat.com/scripts/popcorn/feeds/feed-api-controller.php?action=celeb-data&section=unkown-facts&celeb-id=4968,http://www.filmibeat.com/scripts/popcorn/feeds/feed-api-controller.php?action=celeb-data&section=news&celeb-id=4968,http://www.filmibeat.com/scripts/popcorn/feeds/feed-api-controller.php?action=celeb-data&section=videos&celeb-id=4968,http://www.filmibeat.com/scripts/popcorn/feeds/feed-api-controller.php?action=celeb-data&section=gallery&celeb-id=4968,http://www.filmibeat.com/scripts/popcorn/feeds/feed-api-controller.php?action=celeb-data&section=awards&celeb-id=4968,Kate Winslet,Q202765,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Winslet
